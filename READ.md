# WebApp Styling
This repository will be dedicated to developing the html and css for the web application.

## Layout
All the html files for the web application should be stored in `cei/templates/cdei` and the corresponding stylesheets and JavaScript should be placed in `cei/static/cdei`. Please try to stick to this format as close as possible since this is the exact directory structure has for its html and css.
